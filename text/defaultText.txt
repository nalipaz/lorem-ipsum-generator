The standard default text is designed to ramble about nothing. After Hours Programming created this application. Default text is for web developers and designers that need default text quickly. A designer can use default text to simulate what text would look like. Humans are creative beings. However, standard default text can do the trick. Whoever evaluates your text cannot evaluate the way you write. Default text creates the illusion of real text. People tend to read writing. If it is not real text, they will focus on the design. Your design looks awesome by the way. It looks even better with you using this text. Using default text is a simple way to create the appearance of content without having to create it. This string is randomly  generated. This text will not appear in a consistent order. JavaScript has the awesome power to manipulate DOM elements on the fly. That is preciously how this string was constructed. Thank you for using this application. I hope you enjoyed the fake text. I hope you did not actually read this text and enjoyed your sweet design. Have a wonderful day.
