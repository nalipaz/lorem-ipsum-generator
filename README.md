# lorem-ipsum-generator
Google Chrome extension for Lorem Ipsum Generation

This is a fork of the Google Chrome extention [Lorem Ipsum Generator (Default Text)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lorem-ipsum-generator-def/mcdcbjjoakogbcopinefncmkcamnfkdb?hl=en). It has the additional features of:

 1. Remembering settings and storing them in chrome sync so they synchronize across browsers.
 2. Providing additional Ipsum text variants.
 3. Moving the Ipsum text variant selection to the main dialog for easier toggling.

This extension was originally written by [After Hours Programming](http://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/). I have only made the above additional functionality and made what I consider improvements to some of the code. I make no claim over ownership or copyright to any of the code posted by After Hours Programming.
